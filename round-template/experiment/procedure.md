1.Identify various functions/buttons/elements that you require on your TV remote control panel.

2.Clearly specify function and label of each button on the panel.

3.Find operational sequences for carrying out various tasks on your remote.

4.Freeze a list of all buttons finally required in your panel layout.

5.After you press Click Here in simulator tab a prototype builder environment will be available to you.

6.This prototype builder consists of

  a.Panel sheet (in center)– Central area with panel cutout for creating layout.

  b.Control button tool box (at right side) - Contains control buttons that can be dragged.

  c.Function keys (on top)– for placing grids, freezing/unfreezing panel sheet, clearing the panel sheet and finally exiting the program.

7.We recommend you to draw a pencil sketch of the layout to be designed before you start. Chose one or combination of the principles like operational sequence principle, frequency of use principle or centre of attention principle.

8.Start dragging keys from tool box and placing them on the panel sheet. Drag relevant labels and place them appropriately.

9.Make use of a grid by pressing appropriate function button on the top. Drag and place various controls in a logical orderly way.

10.Once you are done, you can freeze the panel to avoid further changes. Cross check with a reference sample layout. Please note, there is no one correct solution. There could be many layouts that are equally good.

11.Compare the standard solution with your prototype and list down the differences in your designed configurations.
